I keep the linked lists in alphabetically sorted order by creating new NameLL for both genders. 
I want to sort a name only once in the list, so I check the index of the name, 
if the index is -1, meaning it has not existed in the list, I will pass the new name in, 
otherwise, the name will not be inserted into the array. This makes sure that each name is sorted only once and alphabetically in the list.

The home is super challenging to me. I spent almost more than 20 hours on this. It requires a long time of designing and thinking.
The debugging took a really long time.
